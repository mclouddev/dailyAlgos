//Sieve Implementation
//The sieve works by first assuming that all numbers from

//{2,\dotsc,n\}{2,â€¦,n}
//are prime, and then successively marking them as NOT prime.

//The algorithm works as follows:

//Create a list of all integers from 2 to n.
//Start with the smallest number in the list (2, the smallest prime number).
//Mark all multiples of that number up to n as not prime.
//Move to the next non-marked number and repeat this process until the entire list has been covered.
//When the steps are complete, all remaining non-marked numbers are prime.
